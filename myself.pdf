1. Tell me about yourself.
My name is Sumant, and I’m from Uttara Kannada. I recently completed my BCA from SDM College, Honnavar, where I built a strong 
foundation in programming languages such as Python and SQL. Over time, I developed technical skills in tools commonly used in data 
analytics — including Excel for reporting and dashboards, SQL for querying databases, Python for data cleaning and visualization, and
Power BI for creating interactive dashboards and insights.
Recently, I completed two projects — a COVID-19 dashboard and a Real Mart sales dashboard — which gave me practical experience in 
analyzing data and presenting findings visually.
I’m now eager to start my career in Data Analytics and apply my skills to solve real-world business problems.


2. Why did you choose a career in data analytics or data science?
I chose a career in Data Analytics because I enjoy working with data and finding meaningful insights from it. I like how data helps 
in making decisions based on facts rather than assumptions. During my projects, I realized that analyzing data, identifying patterns, 
and visualizing results is something I am naturally interested in. So, I decided to build my skills in tools like Excel, SQL, Python 
and Power BI. I believe this field has great growth opportunities and I am excited to solve real-world business problems through data.


3. What do you know about our company and why do you want to work here?
Your company has a good reputation for learning, growth and innovation. I want to work here because I can contribute to the team 
while also improving my skills and growing professionally.


4. Describe a time when you faced a challenge in a project and how you handled it.
During my recent data analysis project, I faced a challenge with inconsistent and missing data in the dataset. The dataset had 
different date formats, null values, and duplicated entries, which was affecting the accuracy of the analysis.My task was to clean and
prepare the data so that the analysis and dashboard would be accurate.


5. How do you handle tight deadlines or pressure at work?
I stay calm, prioritize the important tasks, and focus on completing them step-by-step. I also communicate with the team if needed. 
This helps me manage deadlines without compromising quality.

6. How do you explain complex data insights to non-technical people?
When explaining complex data insights to non-technical people, I focus on keeping the explanation simple, clear, and related to their
goals. I avoid technical terms and instead use everyday language, visuals, and real-life examples.


7. Describe a situation where your analysis or recommendation made a positive impact.
I identified that some high-sales products had low profit due to excessive discounting. I presented this insight using a dashboard and
recommended optimizing the pricing strategy. This helped improve focus on high-margin items and supported better decision-making.


8. How do you handle feedback or criticism?
I take feedback positively, understand the suggestions, and use them to improve my skills and work quality.

9. What are your short-term and long-term career goals?
My short-term goal is to learn and grow in a data analyst role. My long-term goal is to become an expert in the data field and take 
on leadership responsibilities.


10. What motivates you to do your best work?
I am motivated by learning, solving problems, and seeing the impact of my work. The feeling of progress and growth encourages me to 
do my best.
