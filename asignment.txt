2) History of python
 Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989 at the CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica) research center in the Netherlands. Guido wanted to design a programming 
 language that was simple, easy to understand, and powerful. He started working on it as a hobby project during his Christmas holidays.

 The first version, Python 0.9.0, was released in 1991. It already included features like functions, exception handling, and core data types, which made it unique and 
 user-friendly.

 In 1994, Python 1.0 was released, followed by Python 2.0 in 2000, which introduced automatic garbage collection and Unicode support. The language continued to grow 
 and gained a large community.

 Later, Python 3.0 was released in 2008 to remove the limitations and old designs of Python 2. It was not backward compatible, but it made Python cleaner and more 
 efficient for modern applications.

 Finally, on January 1, 2020, official support for Python 2 ended, and now Python 3 is the standard version used around the world.

 Today, Python is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages, especially in data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, web development,
 and automation because of its simplicity, readability, and large library support.

1. What is Python and why is it called an interpreted language?
   Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is widely used for tasks like web development, data science, machine learning, automation, artificial
   intelligence, game development, and more.

2. What are the key features of Python that make it popular for beginners and professionals?
    1. Simple and Easy-to-Read Syntax
    Python code looks close to English.
    This makes it easier to understand, write, and learn—especially for beginners.

    2. Interpreted Language
    Python does not need to be compiled.
    You can run code directly, which makes development and testing quick and efficient.

    3. High-Level Language
    You don’t need to worry about memory management, hardware details, or complex internal operations.
    Python handles these automatically.

    4. Large Standard Library
    Python comes with many built-in modules for tasks like:

    Math
    File handling
    Networking
    Data processing

    5. Cross-Platform Support
    Python works on:
    Windows
    macOS
    Linux
    Mobile & Cloud Platforms
    Write code once → Run anywhere (with Python installed).

   6. Object-Oriented + Functional Programming
   Python supports:
   OOP (classes & objects)
   Functional programming (lambda, map, filter)
   Procedural programming
   This flexibility helps professionals design large-scale applications.

   7. Huge Community and Support   
   Python has a very large global community, so:
   Plenty of tutorials and online help
   Libraries for almost everything
   Easy to find solutions to errors

   8. Extensive Libraries and Frameworks
   Python is powerful because of its ready-made libraries:

   9. Suitable for Rapid Application Development
   Python lets you prototype quickly.
   This saves time in startups, research, and corporate projects.

   10. Open Source and Free
   Python is free to download, use, and distribute.
   No license cost → widely adopted in education & industry.


3. What is the difference between Python 2 and Python 3?
   Python 2 and Python 3 differ mainly in syntax and functionality. Python 3 uses print() function, supports Unicode by default, and performs true division. Python 2 
   is outdated and no longer maintained, while Python 3 is the current and widely used version.

4. What are Python’s applications in real-world projects?
   Web Development
   Python provides frameworks such as Django, Flask, and FastAPI to build secure, scalable, and dynamic web applications.

   Data Science and Data Analysis
   Python is heavily used in analyzing, visualizing, and processing data using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

   Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
   Python is the most popular language for developing ML/AI models using TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, and Keras.

   Automation and Scripting
   Python is often used to automate repetitive tasks such as file handling, data entry, testing, and report generation.

   Game Development
   Game engines like Pygame are used to create simple 2D games, while Python is also used for AI scripts in larger game engines.

   Desktop Application Development
   Tools like Tkinter, PyQt, and Kivy allow developers to build GUI-based desktop software.

   Networking and Cybersecurity
   Python is used to create network tools, security testing scripts, malware analysis, and penetration testing (ex: Nmap, Scapy).

   Cloud Computing and DevOps
   Python is used in automation tools, configuration management, and cloud APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP) for building scalable applications.

   Internet of Things (IoT)
   Python can run on small hardware like Raspberry Pi to build IoT systems, smart devices, and automation sensors.

5. What is PEP 8 and why is it important in Python programming?
   PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8) is the official style guide for writing Python code.
   It provides rules and best practices on how to format Python programs to make them clean, readable, and consistent.

   Why is PEP 8 Important?
   *Improves Code Readability
   By following PEP 8 rules, Python code becomes easier to read and understand for everyone.

   *Maintains Consistency
   When many developers work on the same project, PEP 8 ensures the code style remains uniform.

   *Makes Debugging Easier
   Clean and properly formatted code helps identify and fix errors faster.

   *Professional Coding Standard
   Following PEP 8 shows you write code in a standard and professional manner.    


6. Who developed Python and in which year was it released?
   Python was developed by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer.
   It was first released in the year 1991.


7. What do you mean by “dynamically typed” in Python?
   Python is called a dynamically typed language because you do not need to declare the data type of a variable when you create it.
   The type is decided automatically at runtime, based on the value assigned to the variable.


8. What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter, and which does Python use?
   Feature	                 Compiler	                                                             Interpreter
   Translation Method	      Converts the entire program into machine code at once.	              Translates and executes code line-by-                                                                                                     line.
   Execution Speed	Faster   after compilation because the machine code is already generated.	    Slower because each line is interpreted                                                                                                   during execution.
   Error Detection	         Shows all errors after compilation.	                                 Shows one error at a time while running.
   Memory Usage	            Requires more memory to store machine code.	                         Requires less memory.
   Examples	                C, C++, Java (with JVM).	                                            Python, JavaScript, PHP.
