1) what are pros and cons of python?

  *Pros of python
  1. Easy to Learn & Read
     Python syntax is simple like English, so beginners can learn it quickly

  2. Large Community Support
     A huge global developer community helps in solving problems faster

  3. Rich Libraries & Frameworks
     Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Django, Flask make development faster

  4. Versatile Language
     Used in Web Development, Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, Automation, Scripting, IoT and more

  5. Platform Independent
     Python code runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac without changes

  6. Integration Friendly
     Works well with C/C++/Java and databases; easy to integrate in projects

  7. Rapid Development
     You can build prototypes and applications faster compared to other languages


  *Cons of python
  1. Slower Speed
     Python is slower than C/C++/Java because it is an interpreted language

  2. Not Ideal for Mobile Apps
     Python is not widely used for Android/iOS mobile app development

  3. Higher Memory Usage
     Programs written in Python often use more memory (not good for very large systems)

  4. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
     Makes multi-threading slower, limiting performance in CPU-heavy tasks

  5. Weak in Browser/Front-end Development
     You cannot run Python directly in browsers like JavaScript



2) History of python
 Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989 at the CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica) research center in the Netherlands. Guido wanted to design a programming 
 language that was simple, easy to understand, and powerful. He started working on it as a hobby project during his Christmas holidays.

 The first version, Python 0.9.0, was released in 1991. It already included features like functions, exception handling, and core data types, which made it unique and 
 user-friendly.

 In 1994, Python 1.0 was released, followed by Python 2.0 in 2000, which introduced automatic garbage collection and Unicode support. The language continued to grow 
 and gained a large community.

 Later, Python 3.0 was released in 2008 to remove the limitations and old designs of Python 2. It was not backward compatible, but it made Python cleaner and more 
 efficient for modern applications.

 Finally, on January 1, 2020, official support for Python 2 ended, and now Python 3 is the standard version used around the world.

 Today, Python is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages, especially in data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, web development,
 and automation because of its simplicity, readability, and large library support.
